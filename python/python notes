why python?
----------------
1) It is a opensource.
2) has huge cummuntiy support.
3) cross platform programming lanugauge (run in any machine).
4) huge set of libraries and tools.

Python :
-----------
Python is an interpreted general-purpose/ multi-purpose high-level programming with easy syantax and dynamic semantics.

dynamic semantics -> variables are dynamic objects.

eg:-
       c-program                               python code
      ----------                             ----------------
int x=10;                                          x=10;
int y=5;                                            y=5; 
printf("%d",x+y);                                    print(x+y)

here x and y are integers throughout              here x and y has no type,so we can assign any typeof value to these variables,later in code
the program,beacuse we are specifiying                 ( it is called dynamically typed).
it statically.


Traslator :
---------------
It converts a high-level language code to the binary language code.
2 types-> a)complier.
           b) Interpreter.
